"""REPL log-spam quieting (FIX-logspam).

On the live SO-101 arm REPL, a step failure (e.g. "no strategy matched",
"execution failed") is emitted as a cognitive-layer WARNING AND already rendered
in the rich step UI ("[FAIL] ..."). With ``basicConfig(level=WARNING)`` those
duplicate WARNINGs propagate to the root console handler and flood the screen
(2x per step across retries) — pure noise.

``cli._setup_logging`` quiets the cognitive package logger to ERROR on the
non-verbose REPL console only. This must:
  - quiet ``vector_os_nano.vcli.cognitive`` to >= ERROR when NOT --verbose,
  - leave it un-quieted under --verbose (full DEBUG preserved),
  - NOT silence ERROR/CRITICAL (only WARNING/INFO/DEBUG are dropped),
  - scope to the cognitive package only (never the root logger).

The fix lives on the CLI entry path; library code / the test suite never call it.
