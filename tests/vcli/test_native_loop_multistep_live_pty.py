"""M1 STEP 3 (B) — LIVE multi-STEP: the model autonomously decomposes a 2-leg journey.

Step 2 (``test_native_loop_live_llm_pty.py``) proved the REAL model drives ONE
autonomous walk->verify leg. The legacy planner's defining job is multi-STEP
DECOMPOSITION: given one instruction naming several waypoints, break it into ordered
verified legs. This module is that proof for the native producer — a SINGLE NL turn
naming TWO targets, decomposed by the MODEL (not the runner) into two walk->verify
legs on the REAL go2 sim, graded by the UNTOUCHED honest spine.

The prompt names BOTH coordinates and NO tool::

    先走到坐标 (11.0,3.0)，到了之后再走到 (12.0,3.0)

The runner owns NONE of the decomposition — it does not inject legs, does not
replan, does not sentinel-verify. The model alone must:
  - issue >= 2 walk->verify legs (the multi-step decomposition);
  - route EVERY leg to ``walk`` (never ``navigate``, not offered) verifying with the
    registry-derived ``at_position(...)`` oracle (the fix-6 routing contract);
  - target BOTH coordinates — at least one leg verifying near (11,3) AND at least
    one near (12,3) (proves it decomposed the journey, not just walked once);
  - earn >= 1 GROUNDED step from a real displacing walk.

HONEST grading (reuses step 2's philosophy, never loosens the moat): the honest
``evidence_passed`` gate requires EVERY step GROUNDED for the whole turn to verify.
The legged gait UNDER-SHOOTS each ~1m walk command, so a leg frequently lands short
(RAN) before the model autonomously walks again (GROUNDED). A RAN+GROUNDED mix
honestly reports the whole turn RAN/exit2 — that is the gate working, not a failure.
We therefore pin full-turn ``verified True`` ONLY when EVERY step is grounded; we
NEVER force a partial run green. ``verified == (exit==0)`` is asserted inside
run_cli_turn regardless.

GATE (LIVE, non-deterministic, billed). SAME double gate as step 2: SKIPPED unless
BOTH a real provider key is present in the repo-root ``.env`` AND ``VECTOR_LIVE_LLM=1``
is set. Reproduce::
