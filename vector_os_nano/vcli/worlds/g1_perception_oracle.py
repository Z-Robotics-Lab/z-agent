"""g1 perception verify oracle — the HONEST GROUNDED for a camera-only embodiment.

R7. g1 (humanoid, head camera, NO arm) has no weld-causation path, so the only
honest GROUNDED for it is a GT-BACKED PERCEPTION MATCH: the learned detector
localizes an object on g1's camera (its box = the CLAIM), and the verify oracle
judges that claim against INDEPENDENT SIM ground truth the detector cannot author.

This is NOT the R4 self-read that minted a false green (D61). R4 bound
``detect_objects()`` over the detector's OWN stashed boxes and graded
``len(detect_objects()) > 0`` — the actor certifying itself (a tautology). Here:

  - the TRUTH is the MuJoCo SEGMENTATION render — the renderer's OWN per-pixel
    geom-id image of the scene geometry, taken from the SAME camera as the RGB. It
    is physics+render ground truth: it knows EXACTLY which pixels show the red
    object, with ZERO projection-convention guesswork (the engine does the
    projection, not us). The detector never sees it.
  - the CLAIM is the detector's box, obtained by running grounding-dino on the
    live RGB frame ONLY (the firewall: ``G1HeadPerception`` exposes only
    ``get_color_frame`` to the detector, never the segmentation/geom data).
  - the oracle returns True IFF a detected box CENTER lands within ``tol`` pixels of
    the SEGMENTATION CENTROID of the matching-colour geoms.

So the oracle returns "the detector's localization MATCHES where the SIM render says
the object actually is" — not "the detector found something". A WRONG detection (a
box on a wall, the wrong object) or the object OUT OF VIEW (no matching-colour geom
in the segmentation) → no match → False → the step grades RAN/FAILED, never
GROUNDED. GROUNDED must be EARNED by a spatially-correct localization (the refutation
proof).

WHY SEGMENTATION, NOT A HAND-ROLLED world→pixel PROJECTION (R7 honest pivot): the
freejoint pickables the GT-body accessor tracks turned out to be OCCLUDED in g1's
spawn view (segmentation: 0 px) — the red the detector sees is the static red bar
STOOL, which has no freejoint. And the head camera's pose-vs-frame relationship did
not reconcile under a standard pinhole convention (a 44° depression angle rendering
at mid-frame), so a hand-rolled ``world_to_pixel`` was UNRELIABLE — staking GROUNDED
on it would be a convincing-but-wrong result. The MuJoCo segmentation render sidesteps
both: it localizes whatever red geometry is ACTUALLY in view, in the renderer's own
exact pixels, no convention assumed. It is strictly MORE independent + MORE reliable
than the projection plan, and just as invisible to the detector.

Moat placement (kernel rule 2): this lives WORLD-side (``vcli.worlds``), bound into
the verify namespace by ``RobotWorld.build_verify_namespace``. The frozen
``vcli/cognitive/`` spine is BYTE-UNCHANGED — the oracle reaches GROUNDED purely by
being a STATE oracle the model compares against a constant
(``detection_matches_gt('red') == True``), which the existing
``evidence_classifier`` already grades GROUNDED.

Fail-safe contract (same as the arm/go2 oracles): a missing base / renderer / detector,
no matching-colour geom in view, or any read failure → the oracle returns ``False``
(never raises into the GoalVerifier sandbox, never a spurious True). Stricter-only.
