"""Single-source deterministic sim-oracle grounding (ADR-008 C1).

This module is the ONE place the arm/scene verify predicates live. It is consumed
by BOTH the PlaygroundWorld (preset tabletop scenarios) and the plain RobotWorld
(the normal "open the sim -> grasp the banana" CLI path), so the grounding logic
is never duplicated (kernel rule 3: no split-brain). It lives in the kernel side
of the seam (``vcli.worlds``) because the kernel/RobotWorld must NOT import the
playground package — the dependency edge is one-way (playground -> kernel only,
ADR-008 / kernel rule 2). The playground's ``verify/arm_predicates`` and
``verify/scene_predicates`` modules are now thin re-export shims over this file.

These are the callables a sub-goal's ``verify`` expression evaluates against. They
read the sim's DETERMINISTIC ground truth — ``get_object_positions`` /
``get_joint_positions`` / ``fk`` on the connected arm — never the VLM. The VLM
detect/describe pipeline stays the agent's perception *skill*; the verifier checks
the oracle (ADR-008: generator and verifier independent).

Grounding contract:
- WORLD-AGNOSTIC: the arm is reached from the agent only via duck-typing —
  ``getattr(agent, "_arm", None)`` and ``getattr(agent, "_gripper", None)`` (the
  same accessors the CLI / sim tool use). The module never imports a concrete
  world or embodiment.
- FAIL-SAFE: when the arm is absent or not connected, every predicate FAILS SAFE
  (returns ``False`` / ``0`` / ``[]`` / ``""``) — it must NEVER raise into the
  GoalVerifier sandbox.
- Each predicate is a thin factory bound to the connected ``agent`` so the engine
  can drop them straight into the verify namespace.

The predicates are intentionally side-effect-free: ``fk`` and joint reads do not
advance the sim, and object reads are pure ground-truth lookups.
