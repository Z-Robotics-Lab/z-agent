"""Robot world shim.

Phase A keeps the robot path working exactly as before: this shim is the
registration *surface* (persona + "use kernel defaults" for vocab), while the
robot verify namespace and skill tools continue to be built by the engine/CLI
as today. It deliberately imports nothing robot-specific at module load.
