# which built ``detect_objects()`` over ``agent._last_detection`` — the LEARNED
# detector's OWN stashed boxes (the MEANS' output). Binding that into the verify
# namespace made ``len(detect_objects()) > 0`` a *truth-bearing* oracle over the
# means' own product, so the R1 evidence gate graded the g1 detect step GROUNDED:
# the detector certifying ITSELF (a TAUTOLOGY — the actor's output verifying the
# actor). That was a FALSE GREEN (red-team, D61). A detector running + localizing
# is READ-ONLY perception: there is no actor-caused world change to ground, and
# the verify must never read the means' own output as if it were an independent
# oracle (rule 5: the sandbox only gets stricter; rule 4 #moat: GT anchors stay
# invisible to the means). With NO ``detect_objects`` in the camera-no-arm
# namespace, the native detect tool's ``verify(len(detect_objects()) > 0)`` finds
# no oracle name in the live verify-namespace, so ``classify_verify_expr`` returns
# RAN (no oracle call) — fail-closed to the honest D50 grade. The detector still
# REGISTERS + ROUTES + localizes (the genuine cross-EMBODIMENT x cross-MODEL
# achievement, kept); only the dishonest GROUNDED is removed.
#
# A legitimate FUTURE GROUNDED for detection (possible R6, NOT done) would require
# a GT-backed spatial match — the detector's box back-projects to where the SIM GT
# says the object is — i.e. an oracle INDEPENDENT of the means, not a self-read.
