"""Goal-authenticity helpers for OBJECT (grasp/pick) goals (D17) — the object-goal
analogue of ``coord_goal`` (D15/D16).

The honest moat (R1 structural + R2b actor-causation) proves a step consumed a real
oracle AND, for a ROBOT predicate, that the actor caused the change. But a grasp goal
whose verify is a NON-robot, author-writable predicate (``file_exists('grabbed.txt')``,
``len(describe_scene()) > 0``, ``path_contains(...)``) slips through: ``file_exists`` is
a PREDICATE oracle so it classifies GROUNDED structurally, and being a non-robot
predicate it is never actor-causation-graded. That is exactly the fakeable-grasp
false-green this module closes — deepseek satisfied "抓前面的东西" by writing a marker
file and verifying the file, never the gripper (D17, see docs/tricky-bugs.md).

These PURE helpers let the turn-level gate (``trace_store.evidence_passed``) REJECT such
a grasp goal: a goal commanding a physical grasp/pick must be GROUNDED via a GT
MANIPULATION oracle (``holding_object`` / ``placed_count``) that the actor cannot author
— never a self-authored file/scene/marker predicate.

Properties (rule 5 / honest-by-construction — IDENTICAL discipline to coord_goal):
- STRICTER-only: the gate uses these ONLY to turn a FALSELY-GREEN grasp turn RED, never
  the reverse. It can only REJECT (the turn already classified all-GROUNDED) and can
  never fake-pass (the satisfying step must ITSELF be GROUNDED).
- FAIL-OPEN: a goal with no grasp/pick intent returns False -> the gate does not apply,
  the existing classification stands. So nav / dev / place-only / detect goals are
  untouched.
- Honest: intent is parsed from the user's NL command (``goal_tree.goal``, passed verbatim
  by the producer), NEVER from actor-authored state. The model authors only the verify
  expr, never the goal — so it cannot make the parsed intent disappear.
- SCOPED by the caller to a world whose live oracle set contains ``holding_object`` (an
  arm world), so go2-coordinate / dev / g1-detect worlds never see this gate.
