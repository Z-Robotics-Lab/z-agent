"""trace_store — persist, reload, and replay VGG execution traces.

Turns a run's ``ExecutionTrace`` into a replayable, self-grading eval signal:

- ``save_trace`` / ``load_trace`` round-trip a trace to JSON under
  ``~/.vector/traces/`` (frozen dataclasses -> dicts and back; tuples survive).
- ``replay`` re-evaluates each sub-goal's *deterministic* verify predicate with
  a fresh ``GoalVerifier``. Visual overrides are NOT reproduced — only
  deterministic evidence counts, which is the point of replay.
- ``evidence_passed`` gates a "verified done": in the dev world a step backs the
  outcome with evidence only when its verify is a real predicate (not the
  sentinels ``""`` / ``"True"``) AND that predicate verified. Robot worlds bypass
  the gate so async motor skills that legitimately use ``verify="True"`` do not
  regress.
