"""actor_causation — grade whether the ACTOR caused a robot step's state change.

R2b. The R1 evidence gate proves a step's verify predicate is GROUNDED (consumes a
real world oracle, non-tautologically, with ``verify_result=True``). But a GROUNDED
predicate alone does NOT prove the *actor* (the robot under command) caused the
post-state — a NO-OP step whose target was already satisfied at baseline, or a code
sub-goal that teleports ``qpos`` with no motor command, both make ``at_position(...)``
true without the actor walking there. This module adds the missing conjunct: a
GROUNDED robot-predicate step is DOWNGRADED to RAN unless the actor actually
COMMANDED motion via the instrumented control path AND the pose changed.

SCOPED HONESTY CLAIM (verbatim — red-team THIS, not "closes teleport"):

    R2b grades that the actor COMMANDED motion via the instrumented ctrl path AND
    the pose changed; it does NOT prove the change was caused ONLY by that command.
    A skill that BOTH commands motion AND pokes qpos is NOT caught — deferred to
    shadow-MjData re-step (state-level independence, OUT OF SCOPE).

What it CLOSES: the NO-OP (predicate already true at baseline, no commanded motion)
and the pure-TELEPORT (qpos poked, zero commanded motion) false-greens — both now
grade UNCAUSED and the step downgrades GROUNDED -> RAN.
What it DEFERS: a step that simultaneously commands real motion AND pokes qpos
would still grade CAUSED (the command signal fires); proving caused-ONLY-by requires
a shadow MjData re-step (re-simulate from the baseline applying only the recorded
commands and compare) — explicitly OUT OF SCOPE this round.

ALSO OUT OF SCOPE (documented, deferred): the live go2 ``navigate`` path drives via
a ROS2 bridge whose ``cmd_vel`` runs on another thread and is GATED OUT before the
instrumented counter (``mujoco_go2.set_velocity`` returns at the ``_gated`` guard
when the caller is not the skill-token thread). Only ``walk()``/``walk_forward``
(which set ``_skill_ctrl_tid`` so their ``set_velocity`` is ungated + counted) carry
an honest actor-causation signal. Grading the bridge/nav route is deferred.

Single-sourced into ``classify_step_evidence`` (trace_store) so the actor-causation
verdict flows to BOTH gates and the VECTOR_VERDICT report — no split-brain.
