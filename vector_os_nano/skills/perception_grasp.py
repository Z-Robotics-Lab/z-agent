"""PerceptionGraspSkill — the honest, perception-driven Go2+Piper grasp.

This is the skill the North Star calls for: the robot LOCALIZES the target the
way a real robot must — perceive it — instead of reading the simulator's
omniscient object table.

Pipeline (the goal, verbatim):
    VLM 识别 (Moondream bbox)
      -> EdgeTAM 分割 (binary mask)
      -> pointcloud 取中点 (mask + REAL rendered depth -> camera-frame centroid
         -> world via the exact MuJoCo cam->world transform)   [grasp_point.py]
      -> IK + grasp motion (REUSES the proven PickTopDownSkill via its
         params['target_xyz'] seam — no re-implemented motion)
      -> verify  holding_object('<name>')

Contrast with PickTopDownSkill (skills/pick_top_down.py): that skill reads the
object's world pose from a pre-populated world model (ground truth). This skill
NEVER does — the 3D grasp point comes only from depth + mask. If perception
fails (no detection / empty mask / no depth points) it FAILS LOUD with a precise
diagnosis; it must NEVER silently substitute a ground-truth pose to stay green
(that re-fakes perception, the exact thing the goal forbids).

The verify oracle holding_object('<name>') stays ground-truth and BYTE-UNCHANGED
(it is the moat oracle the actor cannot author): the skill only EMITS the verify
string, it never imports/evaluates the oracle or feeds the centroid into it.

    The dog reaches here already routed head-on to the perceive standoff (~0.95 m) by

    remaining short hop to the IK-reachable standoff is the FLAKIEST link when handed
    back to the vgraph planner (the prior ``_approach_via_nav`` path): targeting a
    standoff this close to the inflated table obstacle, ``navigate_to`` intermittently
    (a) returns False and dumps the dog metres PAST the object, or (b) returns True at a
    sub-optimally-seated pose a few cm short of the THIN Piper forward-reach band → IK
    still fails. The scripted forward creep ``_approach_object`` instead stall-SEATS the
    dog against the table edge — a kinematically-pinned standoff, repeatable run-to-run
    and independent of planner variance — the proven, most-reliable terminal placement
    (it is exactly what the no-navigate_to path already used, D34-D51).

    So the scripted seat-creep is now the PRIMARY (and only) final-hop mechanism for
    every base — unifying the two former approach branches onto ONE impl (Rule 11):
        1. ``_grasp_ready_repose`` — turn to FACE the object + close any standoff gap
           (a benign no-op when already head-on, as it is after navigate_to_object).
        2. ``_approach_object``    — open-loop forward creep that stall-seats at the
           table edge (steers heading + lateral each step; the proven repeatable pose).
        3. ``_face_object``        — final tight heading align before the grasp.
    World-agnostic: uses only the base's walk / get_position / get_heading surface;
    each step gracefully no-ops if that surface is absent. Always returns True (the
    approach ran best-effort; the caller's post-approach nudge + IK gate are the
