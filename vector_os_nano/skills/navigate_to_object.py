"""NavigateToObjectSkill — drive to the vicinity of a KNOWN object by name.

This is the object-layer counterpart of NavigateSkill (which goes to a named
ROOM).  It is a small composable building block, NOT a hardcoded pipeline:

    object name  ->  SceneGraph.find_objects_by_category  ->  world (x, y)
                 ->  NavigateSkill coordinate drive (FAR planner, hold at goal)

The object's position is the SceneGraph's single source of truth, populated by
look/explore via the depth->world localizer (refactor #1).  Reaching the exact
object cell is NOT the goal here — FAR avoids the object as an obstacle and the
coordinate drive holds the dog in the goal's vicinity.  Precise final approach +
re-perception + grasp is a separate building block (refactor #3); the agent
composes them per situation.

Hardware-agnostic: works with any BaseProtocol exposing navigate_to / get_position.
