"""Single-source runtime capability resolver (CLAUDE.md Rule 11 — no drift).

Three scattered sites used to answer "what can this body do" by ad-hoc duck-typed
``getattr`` probing — the exact capability-by-code drift Rule 11 forbids:
  - ``native_loop._build_motor_tools``  (``agent._base is not None`` -> offer navigate)
  - ``worlds/robot._agent_has_camera``   (perception/base/arm RGB-frame source)
  - ``engine._has_base``                 (``agent._base is not None`` -> nav vocab)

This module consolidates them into ONE resolver returning the already-declared
``CapabilityProfile`` (``embodiments/config.py``), so the question is asked in exactly
one place against one schema.

Authority (deliberate, behavior-preserving — S5a):
  - The GATED flags ``has_base`` and ``camera`` are derived from the SAME runtime
    presence the three sites use today, so rewiring them onto this resolver is
    BYTE-IDENTICAL (pinned by ``tests/unit/vcli/test_capability_profile.py`` and the
    unchanged full suite).
  - The ENRICHMENT flags ``has_arm`` / ``has_gripper`` / ``lidar`` reconcile
    runtime-OR-declared: present iff the live agent has the member OR the body's
    ``robot.yaml`` manifest declares it. This makes the go2+Piper runtime-attach
    honest — bare go2's manifest declares ``has_arm:false`` yet a Piper is bound at
    runtime, so the runtime member wins. ``has_gripper`` / ``lidar`` remain the
    forward seam for S5b+ (no gate reads them).

STALE-PREMISE WARNING (D72 vs D175 — latent misgate, gate G-383-1): D72 introduced
the enrichment flags as "behavior-inert — no current gate reads them", but D175 then
made ``has_arm`` a LIVE manipulation gate (``native_loop._build_motor_tools`` withholds
pick/place/... when ``not has_arm``). So ``has_arm`` is NO LONGER inert: its
runtime-OR-declared authority lets a body that DECLARES ``has_arm:true`` but has bound
no runtime ``_arm`` be offered a manipulation surface it cannot execute — the false-reach
the D175 gate exists to prevent. LATENT only because both shipped manifests declare
``has_arm:false``; a plug-and-play manipulator manifest would hit it. The GATED flags
``has_base`` / ``camera`` are runtime-authoritative for exactly this reason. Making
``has_arm`` runtime-authoritative to match touches accepted ruling D72 -> a CEO gate
(G-383-1), NOT a self-approved change. Pinned by
``tests/vcli/test_declared_arm_gate_tension.py``.

Shifting the GATED flags' authority to the declared manifest (so a body's offered
toolset follows its robot.yaml even before runtime members bind) is a deliberate
FUTURE step — a behavior change when declared and runtime diverge — NOT this round.
