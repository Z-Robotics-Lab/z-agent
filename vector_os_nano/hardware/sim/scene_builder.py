"""Unified MjSpec.attach scene builder — ONE scene-build path for every body.

Rule 11 (embodiments are config, not code): a robot is stood up in the go2
house room by ATTACHING its MuJoCo model into a room-only base spec, never by a
per-robot scene builder. ``build_room_scene`` is world-agnostic: it takes the
robot model path + attach prefix + spawn xy + optional welds/camera (all sourced
from the embodiment config by the caller) and returns the compiled ``MjModel``
plus, optionally, a reloadable scene file on disk.

Why attach (not ``<include>``): the include path is go2-only and cannot prefix
or weld programmatically. ``MjSpec.attach`` + ``compile()`` is uniform across
quadruped / biped / arm and is proven byte-identical to the legacy go2 include
build (same nq/nv/nu/nbody/ngeom/ncam/neq, identical name-sets, identical
class-default-derived joint ranges / geom params).

Why ``normalize_attach_defaults``: MuJoCo 3.9's ``MjSpec.to_xml`` serializes an
attached robot whose defaults nest under a class (go2's ``<default class="go2">``
tree) by wrapping them in an ANONYMOUS (class-less) nested ``<default>``. That
text reloads with ``XML Error: empty class name``. The in-memory compiled model
is unaffected — only the serialized text is malformed — so we repair the text by
hoisting the anonymous wrapper's children up one level before writing. g1's flat
default tree has no such wrapper, so the repair is a harmless no-op for it.
