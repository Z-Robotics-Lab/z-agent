# Verified Agent Kernel — STATUS (resume anchor)

One-page "where are we / what's next". Read this first when resuming; durable design is
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md); hidden-bug lessons are [tricky-bugs.md](tricky-bugs.md).

- Branch: `fix/go2-explore-gait-simdt` (off `master`; `feat/verified-agent-kernel` merged as PR #12).
- Last updated: 2026-06-09.
- Scope guard: this is **vector-os-nano only** — not the UniLab go2arm-grasp work.

## Current state (2026-06-09)

- **Go2 explore gait (飘/瘸腿): FIXED, owner-confirmed live.** Root cause was two-clock skew
  (physics ~0.65× real-time vs wall-tick velocity ramps in the nav bridge) — full case in
  [tricky-bugs.md](tricky-bugs.md) Case 1. Fix `d7e158b`: `_follow_path` ramps + wall-escape
  state machine integrate against sim-dt (`hardware/sim/sim_clock.py` + `MuJoCoGo2.get_sim_time()`).
  Escalation to `/clock`+`use_sim_time` (plan B) NOT needed. Env-gated diagnostics
  (`VECTOR_PHYS_LOG`/`VECTOR_MPC_LOG`/`VECTOR_CMDVEL_LOG` in `mujoco_go2.py`) kept — zero cost
  when off; remove when no longer useful.
- **Arm touchstone: hardened end-to-end** (perception, grounding, decompose target binding,
  real-time timeouts, singular/plural intent, long chains incl. foreach grab-everything,
  place/handover, honest+fast failure, grounded verify). Single-skill AND long-chain NL control
  work live on real deepseek, 中/英.
- **Suite + venv reality:** see CLAUDE.md "Build / test" (venv is `.venv` now; 4 documented
  environmental reds; sim tests open real GL windows on a desktop).

## North star (restated 2026-06-05)

**Vector OS Nano = natural language controls everything**, via a built-in agent that
decomposes NL → plans → executes → verifies → replans (a grounded CLOSED loop). VGG is that
engine; verify is the moat (deterministic, never LLM-graded). Robots are the end; the dev/
macOS path is a means. Generalize across embodiments (arm, go2, future) — never one-off patches.

## Shipped (condensed; details in `git log` + tricky-bugs.md)

- **Phases A–C.2:** kernel/world decoupling (robot-free boot); dev world acts + StrategyStats
  (`80916f4`/`f5b9eb4`, hardening `8e961f8`, e2e `bee46f7`); capability seam + cross-capability
  routing (`62fcfc1`/`2a7c942`).
- **Arm + Stages 0–2** (`aebd61e`, `cdbfada`): SO-101 NL control; window-by-default sim
  (`--headless` opt-out, mjpython auto re-exec); Blackboard + `${step.path}` binding +
  `result_data`; registry-derived decompose vocab (no split-brain).
- **Playground v1 + ADR-008 seam prelude;** **Stage 4** control-flow IR (`foreach` expand from a
  producing step via Blackboard, obs-driven replan hook) + **Go2 second embodiment**;
  **Stage 5** unified controller (every turn — chat included — is a verified trace;
  `VECTOR_LEGACY_TURN=1` one-release fallback; stage5 plan deleted as fully shipped).
- **Live-hardening I–VII** (real CLI + deepseek): retry-strategy fix, REPL log quiet, meta-input
  routing, decompose JSON robustness, mjpython locate fix, **P0 segfault** sync-exec gate
  (`118f886`), RobotWorld sim-oracle grounding (`75cbdba`), LLM-side target binding (`4a2edf7`,
  `f53bd04`), sim grasp z_offset (`c953d72`) → headless NL grasp chain works end-to-end.
- **R2 round (real GUI run findings):** R2-2 skill-declared `typical_duration_sec` timeout floor ·
  R2-3 singular/plural intent + unbound→nearest (sim-gated) · R2-5 sim motor auto-allow
  (ALL-semantics safety) · R2-6 ROS2-absent logs at DEBUG · R2-7 detect/foreach `name`+`label`
  contract, pick fail-fast on absent target, detect honest-empty, grounded place verify
  (`not holding_object()`), target-aware `holding_object(target)` + `picked_object` recorded ·
  R2-8 session compaction orphaned-tool-message 400 fix · go2 base verify grounding (`2edeb25`).
- **Phase E:** W1.1 learning-tier evidence gate (`85d59a2`) · W1.2 fail-loud world-registration
  preflight (`7afe2c0`) · W1.3 scene_graph TextLLM adapter (`c3103ad`) · W1.4 playground
  step-primitives wired live → **Wave 1 complete**; W2.4 typed `failure_class` into replan
  (`14ae43c`).
- **This branch:** engine sync-exec gated on mjpython only — Linux REPL responsive (`fcc6b20`) ·
  go2 gated diagnostics + `get_sim_time()` (`6a39f6c`) · venv reconcile `.venv-nano`→`.venv`
  (`13a9429`) · **the gait sim-dt fix** (`d7e158b`) · docs: tricky-bugs casebook + STATUS condense
  (this commit).

## OPEN — prioritized backlog

1. **Phase E Wave 2 (resume point): W2.3 ObjectMemory re-query-freshest** — the verify
   predicates `objects_in_room`/`find_object` (bound in `engine.py` `init_vgg`) read a
   once-synced stale `ObjectMemory`; make reads re-query the live SceneGraph (store the ref in
   `sync_from_scene_graph`, decay-cache fallback, byte-identical when no ref). NOTE: two prior
   automated attempts died to a workflow harness flake (implement agent finished edits but never
   returned) — implement inline or re-run. Then W2.1 (daemon + run-registry + status/stop/log) /
   W2.2 (RUN_ID watchdog orphan sweep) — both need process-lifecycle coordination if a parallel
   GUI session is running — or Wave 3. Plan: [agent-kernel-phase-e-plan.md](agent-kernel-phase-e-plan.md).
2. **Named-vs-generic grasp (owner picked (a)+(b); (a) shipped, (b) NEXT):** a NAMED target must
   bind or the step fails loudly — never silently grab the nearest (that's a FALSE SUCCESS:
   grabbed a non-apple, reported done). Generic grabs ("抓个东西") keep unbound→nearest. Wire
   pick's verify to the resolved target via target-aware `holding_object()` + the recorded
   `picked_object`. Do NOT just remove unbound→nearest.
3. **Detect-verify close-the-loop (R2-7 deeper):** a detect step's query-less verify
   (`len(detect_objects())>0`) FALSE-PASSES when the specific target is absent. Real fix: verify
   against the detect STEP's own alias-aware output (Rule 4), not a separate oracle call — the
   language principle forbids CN/EN alias tables.
4. **Stage 3 grounding remainder:** VLM `MuJoCoPerception`/`DetectSkill` perception path,
   referring-expression resolution ("the red cup" → object_id), ObjectMemory re-sync (=W2.3).
   **Phase C.3/C.4** (real specialized model in the robot world) stays blocked behind this
   ([agent-kernel-phase-c-plan.md](agent-kernel-phase-c-plan.md)).
5. **Owner-gated window checks (cannot verify headless):** R2-1 `--sim-go2` macOS in-process
   window (opens, no segfault, walk animates; frozen-when-idle is expected v1) · R2-4 single ^C
   aborts to prompt under mjpython, second ^C exits.
6. **Chores:** pin/vendor `convex_mpc` in `pyproject.toml` (a venv rebuild silently loses the
   numpy2 fixes — tricky-bugs Case 2) · cli.py 32 pre-existing ruff errors · canary test for the
   private `mujoco.viewer._MJPYTHON` probe (`viewer_mode`) · remove the TEMP gated diagnostics
   when gait work is truly done · `~/Desktop/vector_os_nano` clone's `go2_vnav_bridge.py` is now
   BEHIND this repo (sim-dt fix not synced) — sync or retire that clone.

## Run / verify

Tests: see CLAUDE.md "Build / test" (canonical command, expected environmental reds).
Quirk: go2 sim load rewrites `mjcf/go2/scene_room_piper.xml` abs paths — `git checkout` it
before committing. Live validation pattern: real CLI + deepseek headless first; GUI/timing/^C
behaviors are owner-window checks — never claim them verified headless.

## Autonomous /loop prompt (the standing mission for owner-away iterations)

Run via `/loop <this prompt>` (no interval => self-paced). Mission-oriented + high-autonomy: each firing
advances the mission as far as it safely can, not a single tiny edit.

> **Mission: advance vector-os-nano toward a generalizable PHYSICAL agent for robots.** Iterate autonomously
> (owner away; auto-approve on; current work branch; ONLY this project, never UniLab). This is
> a mission, not a checklist: make natural language truly control a robot through a grounded CLOSED loop
> (understand -> decompose -> plan -> execute -> verify -> replan -> recover), generalizing across embodiments
> (arm, go2, future) AND tasks. Simulation is a MEANS; the end is a physical robot agent. Push the LLM through
> the whole cognitive layer (language, decomposition, planning, strategy/verify selection, recovery); keep
> grounding/verify/safety DETERMINISTIC — verify is the moat, never LLM-graded. Prefer fixes that remove an
> embodiment asymmetry or generalize a mechanism over one-off patches.
>
> Each iteration, ORIENT then act with judgment — you have wide latitude:
> - ORIENT: read `docs/agent-kernel-STATUS.md` (OPEN backlog + current state), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
>   `docs/tricky-bugs.md`, and memories `vector-os-nano-live-hardening` / `-language-layer` /
>   `workflow-model-tiering`. Optionally run the real cli + deepseek to feel current state and discover issues.
> - CHOOSE a meaningful objective — a bug class, a capability, an architectural improvement — that moves the
>   mission forward. You MAY pursue a FARTHER goal across several workflows/edits in one iteration; don't
>   artificially stop at one tiny change. Decompose it yourself and advance as far as you safely can.
> - BUILD: reproduce/diagnose first, then implement via focused dynamic **Workflows** (implement -> 2-3
>   adversarial reviewers -> critic), chaining as many as the objective needs. Pin agent models per
>   `workflow-model-tiering`. Write/extend tests for logic that matters; add evals where output quality matters.
> - VERIFY HONESTLY: keep the canonical suite green (`.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/vcli
>   tests/unit/vcli -q`); validate behavior headless with the real cli + deepseek wherever possible. Some
>   things only reproduce in the owner's mjpython window (GUI render, real-time timing, Ctrl-C under mjpython)
>   — reason carefully, add what headless coverage you can, and CLEARLY hand the visual/timing confirmation to
>   the owner. Never claim a GUI-visual works unverified.
> - COMMIT + RECORD: self-review the real diff; green-then-commit in isolated, logically-scoped commits,
>   updating STATUS (+ ARCHITECTURE if structure/contracts changed; + tricky-bugs.md if a hidden bug was
>   cracked) and the relevant memory in the SAME commit (Doc Governance). Record what you did + what's next so
>   the next iteration resumes cleanly. **Do NOT push.**
>   `git checkout mjcf/go2/scene_room_piper.xml` if a go2 test dirtied it.
>
> DON'T interrupt the owner to ask — make reasonable decisions and proceed. Only stop/surface on a GENUINE
> blocker: the canonical suite goes red and you can't get it green (halt-on-red; salvage + commit partial
> green), something needs the owner's GUI/hardware confirmation, or an action would be destructive /
> irreversible / outward-facing (push, deploy, delete owner data). Otherwise keep advancing the mission,
> iteration after iteration, then schedule the next one.
>
> Current backlog: the **OPEN — prioritized backlog** section above (advance any; not exhaustive — discover more).
